   * Creating our matcher can be good to select the best possible approach for a given scenario and produce highest quality test, which is clean and maintainable.
   * For instance, we could have a MessageController that delivers messages. It'll receive a MessageDTO, and from that, It'll create a Message to be delivered by
   * MessageService. Our verification will be simple, verify that we called the MessageService exactly 1 time with any Message:
   *
   *    verify(messageService, times(1)).deliverMessage(any(Message.class));
   *
   * Because the Message is constructed inside the method under test, weâ€™re forced to use any() as the matcher.
   * This approach doesn't let us validate the data inside the Message, which can be different compared to the data inside MessageDTO.
   * For that reason, we're going to implement a custom argument matcher.
